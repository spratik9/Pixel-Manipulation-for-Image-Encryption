# Pixel-Manipulation-for-Image-Encryption
Encrypt Text messages and Images with a user input key.
To be sure it works, Every encryption is followed by a decryption code which decrypts the above data.
### if you are encrypting an image , be sure the image is in jpg format.
## step 1: first  in Anaconda.Navigator install  
## After in Lounch Jupyter Notebook**
## step 2: automatically open broeser and jupyer notbook create file and write code**
## setp 3: first in messge encryption-decryption**
1. first your message input in key insert.
2. afte second step your message and key value use after convert to your massage encryption form.
3. encryption messge copy and 3rd code are your messge convert encryption message convert decryption form.

## step 4: this main step in a task Pixel manuplation -for any images encryption form
1. see to code.
2. use to matplotlib.pyplot.
3. see the code  in  4th line in image path add make sure your image path add.
4. after run encrypted image code.
5. and last step run decrypted image code.
